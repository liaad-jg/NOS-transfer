def poly_area(x, y):
    r"""
    A function that computes the polygonal area via the shoelace formula.

    This function allows you to take the area of any polygon that is not self
    intersecting. This is also known as Gauss's area formula. See
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray (1-D)
        the x locations of a polygon
    y : ndarray (1-D)
        the y locations of the polygon

    Returns
    -------
    area : float
        the calculated polygonal area

    Notes
    -----
    The x and y locations need to be ordered such that the first vertex
    of the polynomial correspounds to x[0] and y[0], the second vertex
    x[1] and y[1] and so forth

def is_simple_quad(ab, bc, cd, da):

    Returns True if a quadrilateral is simple

    This function performs cross products at the vertices of a quadrilateral.
    It is possible to use the results to decide whether a quadrilateral is
    simple or complex. This function returns True if the quadrilateral is
    simple, and False if the quadrilateral is complex. A complex quadrilateral
    is a self-intersecting quadrilateral.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ab : array_like
        [x, y] location of the first vertex
    bc : array_like
        [x, y] location of the second vertex
    cd : array_like
        [x, y] location of the third vertex
    da : array_like

def makeQuad(x, y):

    Calculate the area from the x and y locations of a quadrilateral

    This function first constructs a simple quadrilateral from the x and y
    locations of the vertices of the quadrilateral. The function then
    calculates the shoelace area of the simple quadrilateral.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        the x locations of a quadrilateral
    y : array_like
        the y locations of a quadrilateral

    Returns
    -------
    area : float
        Area of quadrilateral via shoelace formula

    Notes
    -----
    This function rearranges the vertices of a quadrilateral until the
    quadrilateral is "Simple" (meaning non-complex). Once a simple
    quadrilateral is found, the area of the quadrilateral is calculated
    using the shoelace formula.
